                          <p> Medical literature shows that targeting mental health issues at a young age can result in better outcomes later in life. Globally, there is 1 suicide occurring every 40 seconds. Youth are also essential to the dissemination of information and change in the perceptions of mental health. Therefore, we strive to focus on delivering mental health education to youth in schools. This program is tailored to cover topics such as autism, OCD, depression, anxiety, self-image, suicide, cyber-bullying, substance & alcohol use, eating disorders, and internet addiction.

                        <p> Many existing hotline and helpline services tend to manage acute crisis, but do not ensure that individual receives follow up and/or long-term care. Each caller to the MINDS helpline will receive a follow up call within 72 hours of their initial call and also at 1 month and 6-month timepoints. Additionally, if a caller is referred to a hospital, tele-therapist, or partner NGO, we will ensure with the referral location that there was adequate follow up by the individual. The important factor to keep in mind, is that even if the individual does not follow up with advised referral, we are part of the individual’s recovery and healing. Research has shown that even one phone call conversation provides significant impact in one’s mental health. </p>
